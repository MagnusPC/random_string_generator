a random string generator written in java for time and memory effeciency https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/

end goal is to have a function for creating a set of randomly generated strings based on a regex, a string length and a set count

ideally i would test both stringbuilder versus a random number generator with hex values to create the strings to see which works best
