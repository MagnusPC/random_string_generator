# readme

This is (*will be) a java library for generating a list of semi-randomly generated string sequences from a console input or a method call. Based on parameters such as list-size, sequence-length, unicode format, and regular expression.

- written in java for time and memory effeciency https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/
- end goal is to have a function for creating a set of randomly generated strings based on a regex, a string length and a set count
- ideally i would test both stringbuilder versus a random number generator with hex values to create the strings to see which works best
